# Tools :wrench:
A collection of tools I use on a day to day basis.

## [Sublime Text 3](https://www.sublimetext.com/3)
Multi-cursor, easy split panes, intuitive keyboard shortcuts, configurable, etc.  Just works.

### Settings / Theme
* [User Preferences](https://github.com/sturdynut/tools/blob/master/Preferences.sublime-settings)
* [Theme - Cobalt2](https://github.com/wesbos/cobalt2)

### What about [Atom](https://atom.io/)?
I also use Atom, but found little things that kept pushing me away.  I think Atom looks awesome, but just not as solid as Sublime Text...yet.

## [ZSH](http://ohmyz.sh/)
CD completion, path expansion, themes.

### Settings / Theme
* [.zshrc](https://github.com/sturdynut/tools/blob/master/.zshrc)
* [Theme - Cobalt2](https://github.com/wesbos/Cobalt2-iterm0)
* [Theme - miloshadzic](#) (oh-my-zsh)
